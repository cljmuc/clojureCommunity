# groceries

We will have 2 slots to make the tests run. 
If you finished earlier there will be some bonus tasks where you will have to 
define the tests yourself. 
Lets get started. You are at the grocery store

1) You want to purchase some groceries, each item has a price that you have to pay.
   Calculate the purchased sum. 
   
| Artikel/item    |   Price
------------------------------
| orangejuice	  |    2,00
| choclate   	  |    1,50
| coffee		  |    3,00
| eggs			  |    2,00
_______________________________


2x O-juice, 1x choclate, 3x coffee -->  2x 2,00€ + 1x 1,50 € + 3x 3,00 € = 14,50 €
2x choclate, 2x orange-juice       -->  2x 1,50€ + 2x 2,00,€             = 7,00 €
