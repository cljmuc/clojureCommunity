# mirror

1)
You are given a string. 
The words are seperated by "\".
Mirror every word vertically or horizontally. 

Make the Tests run. 



2) Too easy? Mix it up
Your input is a string. 
Only every second word shall be mirrored vertically, the rest shall be mirrored horizontally
input: "lVHt\nCDGIdolo\nJVhv\nUstXfrIg" --> solution: "JVhv\nolodIGDC\nlVHt\ngIrfXtsU"

This time you will have to write the test, and add some more meaningful tests
